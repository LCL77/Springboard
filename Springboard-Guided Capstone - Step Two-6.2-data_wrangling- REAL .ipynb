Big Mountain suspects it may not be maximizing its returns, relative to its position in the market. It also does not have a strong sense of what facilities matter most to visitors, particularly which ones they're most likely to pay more for. This project aims to build a predictive model for ticket price based on a number of facilities, or properties, boasted by resorts (*at the resorts).* \n",

    "Notebooks grow organically as we explore our data. If you used paper notebooks, you could discover a mistake and cross out or revise some earlier work. Later work may give you a reason to revisit earlier work and explore it further. The great thing about Jupyter notebooks is that you can edit, add, and move cells around without needing to cross out figures or scrawl in the margin. However, this means you can lose track of your changes easily. If you worked in a regulated environment, the company may have a a policy of always dating entries and clearly crossing out any mistakes, with your initials and the date.\n",

    "**Best practice here is to commit your changes using a version control system such as Git.** Try to get into the habit of adding and committing your files to the Git repository you're working in after you save them. You're are working in a Git repository, right? If you make a significant change, save the notebook and commit it to Git. In fact, if you're about to make a significant change, it's a good idea to commit before as well. Then if the change is a mess, you've got the previous version to go back to.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Another best practice with notebooks is to try to keep them organized with helpful headings and comments.** Not only can a good structure, but associated headings help you keep track of what you've done and your current focus. Anyone reading your notebook will have a much easier time following the flow of work. Remember, that 'anyone' will most likely be you. Be kind to future you!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, note how we try to use well structured, helpful headings that frequently are self-explanatory, and we make a brief note after any results to highlight key takeaways. This is an immense help to anyone reading your notebook and it will greatly help you when you come to summarise your findings. **Top tip: jot down key findings in a final summary at the end of the notebook as they arise. You can tidy this up later.** This is a great way to ensure important results don't get lost in the middle of your notebooks."

    "`fastEight` has the most missing values, at just over 50%. Unfortunately, you see you're also missing quite a few of your desired target quantity, the ticket price, which is missing 15-16% of values. `AdultWeekday` is missing in a few more records than `AdultWeekend`. What overlap is there in these missing values? This is a question you'll want to investigate. You should also point out that `isnull()` is not the only indicator of missing data. Sometimes 'missingness' can be encoded, perhaps by a -1 or 999. Such values are typically chosen because they are \"obviously\" not genuine values. If you were capturing data on people's heights and weights but missing someone's height, you could certainly encode that as a 0 because no one has a height of zero (in any units). Yet such entries would not be revealed by `isnull()`. Here, you need a data dictionary and/or to spot such values as part of looking for outliers. Someone with a height of zero should definitely show up as an outlier!"

    "So far you've examined only the numeric features. Now you inspect categorical ones such as resort name and state. These are discrete entities. 'Alaska' is a name. Although names can be sorted alphabetically, it makes no sense to take the average of 'Alaska' and 'Arizona'. Similarly, 'Alaska' is before 'Arizona' only lexicographically; it is neither 'less than' nor 'greater than' 'Arizona'. As such, they tend to require different handling than strictly numeric quantities. Note, a feature _can_ be numeric but also categorical. For example, instead of giving the number of `fastEight` lifts, a feature might be `has_fastEights` and have the value 0 or 1 to denote absence or presence of such a lift. In such a case it would not make sense to take an average of this or perform other mathematical calculations on it. Although you digress a little to make a point, month numbers are also, strictly speaking, categorical features. Yes, when a month is represented by its number (1 for January, 2 for Februrary etc.) it provides a convenient way to graph trends over a year. And, arguably, there is some logical interpretation of the average of 1 and 3 (January and March) being 2 (February). However, clearly December of one years precedes January of the next and yet 12 as a number is not less than 1. The numeric quantities in the section above are truly numeric; they are the number of feet in the drop, or acres or years open or the amount of snowfall etc."

    "A casual inspection by eye reveals some non-state names such as Sierra Nevada, Salt Lake City, and Northern California. Tabulate the differences between Region and state. On a note regarding scaling to larger data sets, you might wonder how you could spot such cases when presented with millions of rows. This is an interesting point. Imagine you have access to a database with a Region and state column in a table and there are millions of rows. You wouldn't eyeball all the rows looking for differences! Bear in mind that our first interest lies in establishing the answer to the question \"Are they always the same?\" One approach might be to ask the database to return records where they differ, but limit the output to 10 rows. If there were differences, you'd only get up to 10 results, and so you wouldn't know whether you'd located all differences, but you'd know that there were 'a nonzero number' of differences. If you got an empty result set back, then you would know that the two columns always had the same value. At the risk of digressing, some values in one column only might be NULL (missing) and different databases treat NULL differently, so be aware that on many an occasion a seamingly 'simple' question gets very interesting to answer very quickly!"

You should think carefully about how, or whether, you use this information. Does New York command a premium because of its proximity to population? Even if a resort's State were a useful predictor of ticket price, your main interest lies in Montana. Would you want a model that is skewed for accuracy by New York? Should you just filter for Montana and create a Montana-specific model? This would slash your available data volume. Your problem task includes the contextual insight that the data are for resorts all belonging to the same market share. This suggests one might expect prices to be similar amongst them. You can look into this. A boxplot grouped by State is an ideal way to quickly compare prices. Another side note worth bringing up here is that, in reality, the best approach here definitely would include consulting with the client or other domain expert. They might know of good reasons for treating states equivalently or differently. The data scientist is rarely the final arbiter of such a decision. But here, you'll see if we can find any supporting evidence for treating states the same or differently."

    "Aside from some relatively expensive ticket prices in California, Colorado, and Utah, most prices appear to lie in a broad band from around 25 to over 100 dollars. Some States show more variability than others. Montana and South Dakota, for example, both show fairly small variability as well as matching weekend and weekday ticket prices. Nevada and Utah, on the other hand, show the most range in prices. Some States, notably North Carolina and Virginia, have weekend prices far higher than weekday prices. You could be inspired from this exploration to consider a few potential groupings of resorts, those with low spread, those with lower averages, and those that charge a premium for weekend tickets. However, you're told that you are taking all resorts to be part of the same market share, you  could argue against further segment the resorts. Nevertheless, ways to consider using the State information in your modelling include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* disregard State completely\n",
    "* retain all State information\n",
    "* retain State in the form of Montana vs not Montana, as our target resort is in Montana\n",
    "\n",
    "You've also noted another effect above: some States show a marked difference between weekday and weekend ticket prices. It may make sense to allow a model to take into account not just State but also weekend vs weekday."

Here, we're interesting in focusing on whether distributions look plausible or wrong. Later on, we're more interested in relationships and patterns."

    "These distributions are much better. There are clearly some skewed distributions, so keep an eye on `fastQuads`, `fastSixes`, and perhaps `trams`. These lack much variance away from 0 and may have a small number of relatively extreme values.  Models failing to rate a feature as important when domain knowledge tells you it should be is an issue to look out for, as is a model being overly influenced by some extreme values. If you build a good machine learning pipeline, hopefully it will be robust to such issues, but you may also wish to consider nonlinear transformations of features."

Listen, you should have a healthy concern about using data you \"found on the Internet\". Make sure it comes from a reputable source. This table of data is useful because it allows you to easily pull and incorporate an external data set. It also allows you to proceed with an analysis that includes state sizes and populations for your 'first cut' model. Be explicit about your source (we documented it here in this workflow) and ensure it is open to inspection. All steps are subject to review, and it may be that a client has a specific source of data they trust that you should use to rerun the analysis."

    "Note, in even the last year, the capability of `pd.read_html()` has improved. The merged cells you see in the web table are now handled much more conveniently, with 'Phoenix' now being duplicated so the subsequent columns remain aligned. But check this anyway. If you extract the established date column, you should just get dates. Recall previously you used the `.loc` accessor, because you were using labels. Now you want to refer to a column by its index position and so use `.iloc`. For a discussion on the difference use cases of `.loc` and `.iloc` refer to the [pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html)."

Can you confirm what the target feature is for your desire to predict ticket price? How many rows were left in the data? Hint: this is a great opportunity to reread your notebook, check all cells have been executed in order and from a \"blank slate\" (restarting the kernel will do this), and that your workflow makes sense and follows a logical pattern. As you do this you can pull out salient information for inclusion in this summary. Thus, this section will provide an important overview of \"what\" and \"why\" without having to dive into the \"how\" or any unproductive or inconclusive steps along the way.\n",

    "The key processes and findings from this notebook are: \n",
    "\n",
    "The key processes are data wrangling, cleaning, and pinpointing the important features for modeling. looking at distributions of features is immensely useful in getting a feel for whether the values look sensible and whether there are any obvious outliers to investigate. Some exploratory data analysis belongs here, and data wrangling will inevitably occur later on. It's more a matter of emphasis. Here, we're interested in focusing on whether distributions look plausible or wrong. Later on, we're more interested in relationships and patterns.This step focuses on collecting your data, organizing it, and making sure it's well defined. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main objective of the project to build a predictive model for ticket prices based on a number of facilities and features, and to provide guidance for Big Mountain's pricing and future facility investment plans.The key findings are, New York accounts for the majority of resorts, Montana, is in 13th place. A resort's State is a useful predictor of ticket price, but we don’t want a model that is skewed for accuracy. Creating a Montana-specific model would slash your available data volume, but it would be good to create one as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from some outlier expensive tickets in California, Colorado, and Utah, most prices are from $25 to over $100. States like Montana and South Dakota, show little variability while Nevada and Utah, have the most range in prices. North Carolina and Virginia, have weekend prices far higher than weekday prices. To further understand the correlation between features and ticket prices, there are many potential groupings of resorts. “Those with low spread, those with lower averages, and those that charge a premium for weekend tickets, and a model that includes all resorts in one market share. \n",
    "\n",

    "What columns, if any, have been removed? Any rows? Summarise the reasons why. \n",
    "The heavenly resort column was removed because there was no data about ticket prices, so they may not have opened yet, or is the first season. The fastEight column, was removed because half of the values are missing or the values are zero. \n",
    "Concerning rows, the rows that have no price data (about 14%), were removed because the price data is our target. AdutlWeekday prices were removed  because AdultWeekend prices have more pricing values. \n",
    "\n",
    "Were any other issues found? \n",
    "\n",
    "The issues entailed, missing ticket prices for 16% of resorts, which forced us to drop these resorts from the data, creating a shortage of our target quantity. The discrepancy of having only weekend price and not weekday price, or vice versa, for resorts was also problematic. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some data points were not assigned to states so we had to make an empty set for missing states. Figuring out the naming logic behind “name” was confusing and misleading. There were also two Crystal Mountain resorts, which was confusing. The below features were also concerning. \n",
    "\n",
    "SkiableTerrain_ac because values are clustered down the low end,\n",
    "Snow Making_ac for the same reason,\n",
    "fastEight because all but one value is 0 so it has very little variance, and half the values are missing,\n",
    "fastSixes raises an amber flag; it has more variability, but still mostly 0,\n",
    "trams also may get an amber flag for the same reason,\n",
    "yearsOpen because most values are low but it has a maximum of 2019, which strongly suggests someone recorded the calendar year rather than the number of years.\n",
    "the Silverton mountain skiable area seems to have discrepancies, and should ask the client about this. \n",
    "\n",
    "What remedial actions did you take?\n",
    "\n",
    "To fix some of the glaring issues, we deleted rows and columns that did not have the targeted features, or enough data, clarified the naming logic behind “name”, and added features together to see how that affected the price of tickets. When figuring out the “null” or 0 logic, we created a data dictionary. Because we are missing lots of our target data and data in general, we will be consulting with the client or other domain experts. Also, we’re keeping an eye on the model to make sure it doesn't fail to rate a feature as important (when it should) or being overly influenced by some extreme values, nonlinear transformations of features, is an option. \n",
